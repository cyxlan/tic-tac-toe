## Applied skills
- Wrote factory functions to organize variables and methods
	- Used the IIFE module pattern for one-time functions
	- Used private variables to track internal values
- Created and animated modal and non-modal dialogs
- Used custom classes applied via JS combined with CSS `::before` and `::after` to dynamically add content 

### Learnings
- Used `dataset` to read and write custom data attributes on HTML elements to save data for future reference
- Used `setTimeout()` to hide an element after a set time and `setInterval()` to animate a progress bar
- Used CSS `aspect-ratio` to maintain fixed width-to-height ratio of elements
